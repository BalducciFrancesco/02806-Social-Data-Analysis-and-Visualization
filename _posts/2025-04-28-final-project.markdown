# Part 3
While UFO sightings may feel intense and scary, my analysis takes a data driven approach to look into possible explanations of the sightings. By examining correlations with external factors, such as extreme weather conditions, I explore whether these sightings might be better explained by natural phenomena rather than extraterrestrial activity. 



# Contributions

We worked together on the exercises during class and then collaborated closely, contributing equally to the final project. All student have worked on all parts of the project, but each student had parts that they were responsible for, this can be seen below.
