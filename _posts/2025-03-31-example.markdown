# Crime Data Visualization Report

## 1. Brief Context  
This work is part of our course on data visualization. The focus is on understanding the importance of visualization in exploring and communicating data insights effectively.

## 2. Dataset Context  
- **Source & Acquisition**: [Describe how the dataset was obtained and any references]  
- **Contents**: The dataset includes information on various types of crimes, timestamps, and locations.  
- **Format**: The dataset is available in [mention format, e.g., CSV, JSON, SQL].  

## 3. Goal of the Assignment  
Our objective is to analyze interesting trends in crime data by applying **X techniques** (e.g., statistical analysis, graphical representation).  

## 4. Steps of Analysis  
1. **Exploratory Graphical Analysis**:  
   - We created draft plots to generate hypotheses.  
   - We referenced *The Grammar of Graphics* for structuring our visualization process.  
2. **Refining the Dataset**:  
   - Based on the initial insights, we focused on relevant data points.  
3. **Presentation Graphics**:  
   - We designed clear and informative visualizations.  

## 5. First Plot: Barcharts  
- **Type**: 2x2 grid of bar charts  
- **Data**:  
  - Assault by day of the week  
  - Malicious mischief by day of the week  
  - Assault by time of day  
  - Malicious mischief by time of day  

## 6. Second Plot: SF Heat Map (6 Slides)  
- **Visualization**:  
  - Assault and malicious mischief mapped with two colors.  
  - Weekdays split into three time ranges.  
  - Weekends split into three time ranges.  

## 7. Third Plot: Timeline Chart (Bokeh)  
- **Reference**: [Bokeh Timeseries Guide](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/3.0.3/docs/user_guide/topics/timeseries.html)  
- **Visualization**: Number of crimes per weekend from 2003 to 2024.  
- **Objective**: Identify if the crime rate is improving over time.  

## 8. Conclusions  
[Summarize findings, key takeaways, and any insights from the visualizations.]

![Crime yearly trend for different categories](/assets/images/plot1.png)
Crime trends vary significantly based on type. Robbery remains relatively steady, while larceny theft rises significantly from 2013. From the same year, drug offenses and stolen property decline. Prostitution experiences the greatest decrease, becoming the crime category with the lowest numbers up to recent days.

The plot showing crime counts independently of the category, seems to indicate that the crime level is relatively steady, on the contrary when we look at each individual crime count chart we see that it widely depends on the crime.
